UPGRADE PROCEDURE FOR ILANCE 4.X
###########################################################################

STEP 1
~~~~~~~~~~~~
If you uploaded a new logo for your marketplace and named it "logo.png" or "logo2.png" or "logo-slim.png" and placed it within the /images/default/v4/ folder then it would be advisable for you to back up logos
as the default "ILance Logos" will overwrite those if you re-upload the ./images/default/ folder.

Once you have completed your upgrade procedure and you've overwritten the logos above you can re-upload your customized version of the logos and place them back into /images/default/v4/

STEP 2
~~~~~~~~~~~~
A) Make backup of your marketplace. You should backup files, database schema + data, templates: /templates/default/ (in AdminCP if you have created new ./admincp/templates/).
B) Make sure that if you have new customized add-ons you should back them up from within /functions/xml/ by downloading them first to your local computer.


STEP 3
~~~~~~~~~~~~
You should disable ILance API Hooks. They can cause issues during upgrade process.  In short, an API hook is a integrated XML file that resides within ./functions/xml/ folder 
which hold the necessary plugin files to make your addon products work.

To disable these plugin files temporarily while we upgrade, please open ./functions/init.php

FIND:
define('DISABLE_PLUGINAPI', false);

CHANGE CODE TO:
define('DISABLE_PLUGINAPI', true);


STEP 4
~~~~~~~~~~~~
A) Download and unzip ILance 4.x to your computer.  
B) Upload all files to your root folder path where the ilance scripts exist.
C) You will be prompted to overwrite files already existing on the server, click YES.
(Optional) You don't have to re-upload the ./images/default/ or the ./cache/ or the ./uploads/ folder so you can skip these specific folders.
(Warning) Do not re-upload the ./install/ folder


STEP 5
~~~~~~~~~~~~
Open file /functions/config.php and make sure you have those values in this file
define('DIR_SERVER_ROOT_IMAGES', '/path/to/ilance/');
define('HTTP_CDN_SERVER', '');
define('HTTPS_CDN_SERVER', '');
define('HTTP_SERVER_OTHER', '');
define('HTTPS_SERVER_OTHER', '');

Additionally, as per ILance 4.0 Build 7984 you need to ensure that these define constants exist in your config.php as well:

define('TEMPLATE_NEWUI', true);
define('TEMPLATE_NEWUI_MODE', 'PRODUCT');

If you are running a service marketplace only please change the PRODUCT above to say SERVICE within the single quotes as above.  Please use UPPERCASE letters.

STEP 6
~~~~~~~~~~~~
Now you should upgrade your add-on products. Documentation on how you should do it is attached to add-on within the package you downloaded from ilance.com.  The file will be called how-to-upgrade.txt and will be located within the add-on package or zip file you've already downloaded.


STEP 7
~~~~~~~~~~~~
Now you can re-enable ILance API Plugin system. Open ./functions/init.php

FIND:
define('DISABLE_PLUGINAPI', true); 

CHANGE CODE TO:
define('DISABLE_PLUGINAPI', false);

STEP 8
~~~~~~~~~~~~
CHMOD 777 to the following folders:
./path/to/ilance/images/default/categoryheros/
