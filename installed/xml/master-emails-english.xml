This notification confirms {{ownername}} just confirmed your delivery for {{project_title}} on {{site_name}}.  If you've purchased a digital item you can pick-up your download from your 'Buying Activity'.  You can then release funds to {{ownername}} to avoid further delay.  

If you've purchased tangible goods this notification confirms that {{ownername}} has physically shipped this item to your location.  In this case, it would be recommended to delay your release of funds within escrow until your item reaches it's destination.  At that point you are required to release funds to your seller.

** Please note that in the event you do not release funds within escrow to the seller after a set period of time {{site_name}} will automatically release funds held escrow to your seller to complete the escrow process on {{site_name}}.

Sincerely,

{{site_name}}

This notification confirms you've confirmed shipment delivery status for {{project_title}} on {{site_name}} to {{biddername}}'s location.

If you've sold a tangible item this notification confirms that the item was shipped already to {{biddername}}'s location.  {{biddername}} has been advised to delay release of funds held within escrow until the item reaches it's destination.  At that point {{biddername}} will be required to release funds into your account balance on {{site_name}}.

Currently the marketplace global settings has 'auto-refund to credit card' set to 'disabled' which means we've just credited {{customer}}'s account balance in the amount of {{refundamount}} and have also deleted the expired credit card on {{site_name}}.

This is an automatic notification that {{site_name}} received a payment response from {{gateway}} informing you that a registered member doing business on {{site_name}} '{{username}}' subscription has been cancelled or has reached it's end of term cycle.

***************************
Cancellation Reasons

1) The subscription cycle has been met.  This is considered the End of Life for this subscription cycle.  {{member}} will need to re-subscribe to a new plan.

3) The staff or owner of the {{gateway}} gateway has cancelled this members subscription automatically which would require no action on the member or your part.  

Ultimately this email is to let you know that one or more of the above events have occured and {{username}} will be required to sign back in to the marketplace and subscribe to a new subscription plan by choosing a free plan or by paying for a completely new one.
